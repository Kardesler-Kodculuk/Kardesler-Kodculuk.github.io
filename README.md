Below is an archive of assignments from multiple lectures done throughout years, done by me and [my group partner](https://github.com/oquzhax), these assignments are put here for educational purposes in case you want a second opinion in your code, assuming the assignments won't change. Please do not attempt to use them directly, as not only that will be detrimental to your education, if caught, it may put you in trouble. Besides, the assignments will change over time, probably.

In any case, for our comfort, and for your pleasure, here is the our archive, the maintainability of the assignment is calculated via [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com), it should give you an idea on the quality of our code (aka: How terrible it is.), moreover, some of the assignments include JUnit Tests for the stuff we wrote, and some even include custom Python tests too, so, enjoy.
